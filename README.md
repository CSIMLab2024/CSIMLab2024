## Hello
Welcome to the Computational Subsurface Imaging and Modeling (CSIM) Lab at Jilin University, led by Professor Jing Li, a specialist in high-precision shallow subsurface geophysics. Our lab conducts cutting-edge research across diverse areas, focusing on advancing inversion imaging techniques to address key challenges in environmental monitoring and urban space applications.
ï»¿
Our work spans a variety of applications, including:
ï»¿
Urban Subsurface Monitoring: Leveraging distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) with fiber-optic technology for real-time, high-resolution monitoring in urban spaces.
Landslide and Fracture Detection: Developing advanced geophysical imaging techniques for accurate detection and monitoring of landslides and subsurface fractures, essential for natural hazard assessment.
Passive-Source and Environmental Noise Monitoring: Using ambient noise as a passive source for seismic imaging and shallow subsurface characterization, enhancing data quality and reducing costs.
Hydrological and Seasonal Freeze-Thaw Processes: Employing ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and other geophysical methods to study seasonal hydrological changes, including freeze-thaw cycles that impact soil stability and water flow.
Our team has made significant contributions to the development of high-resolution inversion techniques and near-surface velocity modeling. Supported by major grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the National Key R&D Program, we have published extensively in top journals like Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, Geophysics, and Geophysical Journal International.
ï»¿
CSIM Lab welcomes collaborations as we continue to push the boundaries of geophysical research for urban infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and hazard resilience.
